# A Practical Perspective on Philosophy

Philosophers take pride in working at the highest level of abstraction, reasoning in the sphere of pure logic and theory. However, non-philosophers love to hate this part of philosophy. There criticism is not unwarranted. It is true that philosophy comes off as high and mighty, and it certainly doesn't help when its practitioners gloat about how clever they are in memorising some terms from the textbook. This is not to say that I hate philosophy, I love philosophy, it is one of the things closest to my heart. But like everything, it has a dark side. And in this particular case it's the intellectual arrogance that comes with the belief of knowing more than other people.

As such I personally advocate for a practical approach to philosophy. I am not as much concerned with correctness as I am with practicality. Take ethics for example. We can formulate the most complicated framework and theory for whether something is right or wrong, and argue with rigorous logic as to what should be done. And yet it seems like we already know what is right or wrong, and are just finding and using the best frameworks to fit to our instinct of what is right and wrong. When we are confronted with a situation, we already instinctively have an idea to who's wrong and who's right. It could be just that we were taught frameworks implicitly thoughout our childhood, but even then, ethics is more like somethings that evolves with society and not like something you can rigorously determine. 

As much as we might try to employ pure logic and explore the realm of pure thought, we are still humans, and any philosophy we can try to apply to real life has take into consideration our human-ness. Our thoughts, emotions and feelings, no matter how irrational and unpredictable, have to be a part of the model. What is the point of deep thought and pondering if we can't use it to make our own lives better, and the lives of those around us better.

My subsequent posts will try to embody this philosophy.

Hopefully it is helpful.
