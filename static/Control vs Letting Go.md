# Control vs Letting Go

Anxiety is that dryness in your mouth, that shaking hand, that racing heart, and that impulse to throw a fist or to run away. It serves to protect us from the future, from what might happen and from the unknown. Ironically, anxiety, just like anything else, when too high in dosage, can impair function in life, performance and cognition.

One key way to deal with this is has to do with understanding the spectrum of control. On one end of the spectrum, are the things fully within your control, how you breathe, how you will act physically, what you can say. In the middle are the things that are harder to control, where some environmental factors come into play, like whether you will attend that meeting on time or whether you allow a friend to take a picture of you. On the other end are the things that are fully outside of your influence, for example, whether it will rain, or if a meteor will hit Earth tomorrow.

Life is so hard because of how hard it is to identify where on the spectrum do situations lie. And life is as always a little harder than even that because depending on your actions and the changes in the environment, how much control you have and what you have control over shift, sometimes drastically and unpredictably. 

There are two things to practice given this reality we find ourselves in, and mastery of these two ideas will greatly aide with anxiety. 

1. Identifying what you have control over and excelling at those (Act as if you have total control)
2. Identifying what you can not control and letting go (Think as if you have no control)

## Just Be Better

Identifying what you can do better, then knowing how to actually improve, then persisting to actually make a change is a heavy lift for anyone in any situation. This section doesn't try to cover how to live life. If I could teach that in a blog post I would be worshipped as a statue in many temples. Instead I will try to focus on the overarching ideas and clarify the common live-life-better advice you would get in self-help books.

### Identifying things within your control

Your dream might be to become a world class dancer, but the first step certainly isn't wishing for the best dance coach in the world to knock on your door and beg to teach you. An objective evaluation of both your environment and your own circumstances is important. For hunters, this might be reviewing what tools they have and what sort of trails are around them. For lawyers this might be what sort of law they are familiar with, what can they learn quickly and what is the case. For aspiring dancers, this might be looking to coaches in the area, what sort of physical abilities do they already have and what sort of practice schedule would lead to improvement.

It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge that something you thought to be outside of your own control is actually within your control. Control implies responsibility. Saying you had control over becoming a great dancer or saving someone's life is almost like saying you were responsible for the outcome of those events. This is also the idea behind "with great power comes great reponsibility". Power gives one control over situations, and that in turns makes them responsible for the outcome. For an alcoholic to acknowledge that it was within their control to seek help, or a student to acknowledge that they could have spend more than 30 minutes before the submission deadline to work on the assignment takes a lot of courage and self-awareness. This is made much easier with a network of compassionate and supportive people and needs an intrinsic realisation that life could and should be better.

### What now?

The next step is to identify what to do about this thing you can control. I can only offer some general advice so your mileage may vary with this section.

#### 1. Seek help from a trustworthy person/resource
Every project I've tried to start on my own or refused to find a mentor for has failed miserably. You can be the most talented person in the world but if you don't learn from others, whether they are live peope around you or an online course or a book, you will never achieve or ammount to anything.

If you can find a good mentor and peers to help and support you through your journey, your chances of success will be astronomically higher. Success is overrated, let's say your chance of experiencing distress will be much lower.

#### 2. Consistency over bursts
Whatever you aim to achieve, be consistent. This means persisting through any and all challenges and adapting along the way. Sometimes dramatic actions or trials are needed to stimulate progress, like a 10 hour report writing session for your Politics course, but these should be used sparingly. Being sustainable and accumulating progress in the total volume and number of hours in an endeavour is much more important than doing something 24/7 for a week and never touching it again. Even for short term situations, often recognising the bigger picture, more general lesson and long term development of the situatioon is very helpful to understanding how you can make actual improvements. If you have an argument with a spouse, think about how you can make a consistent effort over the next year to solve the root cause of the situation. When specific situations arise needing a bit of drama to fix, do it sparingly. It takes the most ferocious lion 3 years to reach maturity.

#### 3. Adapt constantly
As important as it is to persist, it is equally as important to ensure improvement over time. If you constantly try the exact same thing and constantly fail, with no idea whether the environment will change, you are doing it wrong. Always try new things. If you stopped improving in your dancing skills, and you want to be better, maybe it's time to find a new dance coach or to buy an instructional series online or to change up the practice routine. Don't be afraid to make things worse, or to take risks to make things better long term. As unsettling as it is to try new things
and to leave your comfort zone, it is much better getting stuck being uncomfortable for a long time. It certainly is better than regretting and wondering what you could have done back then.

#### 4. Think for yourself (Don't take advice from strangers over the internet)
As cool as I may sound, I am not you. At the end of the day no advice I give will solve your specific issues in life. But you are brilliant, so you'll figure everything out. The best advice in the world is this, "Don't trust every advice you get".


## She'll be alright (It is what it is. Whatever happens, happens.)

Now that you've tried your best to turn the outcome towards what you desire, it is time to let go. Once you hand that resume in, or you've thrown that bowling ball into the lane, it is time to switch off. Your time is over, it is time for god now. If the universe gives you that job, then great, if it doesn't then it's no big deal. If you've really tried your best, it'll seem like the most painful thing in the world to let go of the feeling of control, but you have to. Even though there is no logical basis for this, you just have to trust that fate and the universe has a plan
for you. Not getting that job means that a better job will come along. Even if your house burns down, it's just the universe testing you. There is no rational reason behind thinking like this, it is simply what will power you to go on.


# Summary

How do these things relate to the spectrum of control? The more control you have, the more you use (1), the less control you have, the more you use (2). Have a go, practise this in life. Hopefully it is helpful.
