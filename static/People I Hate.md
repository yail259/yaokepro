# People I hate

Everyone has a personality they can't stand, or a quirk that just bothers them. For me this is people who are disingenuous. I'm not talking about people that want to appear more attractive in front of their crush, or doing their best to comfort others. I hate people who pretend to be nice but are actually assholes. 

As someone who hates arguments and conflict, and hurting other people's feelings, I try to be as respectful and compromising in all my interactions with other people. As such, I find it difficult to deal with argumentative or combative people. But those who are upfront with their harshness and self-aware in their tendencies to fight or argue with others are the easiest to deal with. It is easy for me to set my expectations, and disengage from interactions when I feel tired or stressed. 

The group of people I have the most trouble with, are the people that often say nice things deceptively, tricking you into thinking they are going to do whatever it is you needed from them at that time, and then pulling the rug from underneath you when it really counts. 

## Mental Gymnastics

I think the most apt description of this phenomenon is mental gymnastics. The people I have encountered in my life that does this sort of thing are not inherently sociopathic. They are not tricking me for the sake of tricking me. This is my best attempt of understanding it from my perspective. 

Imagine there is some kind of truth, or some kind of thought deep down that you don't want to accept. Say some girl scouts show up at your door selling cookies. Deep down you really don't want to spend money on the cookies. But you feel bad about turning them away, so instead of giving a straightforward, "no thanks" as an answer, you start weaving a narrative. The gymnastics routine begins. You start telling them about how commendable they are and how brave and wonderful it is they are willing to do this. Now that you've peppered them up with some nice compliments and gotten their expectations high, you need to start coming up with some legitimate reasons why you can't buy the cookies. Do these cookies have gluten in them? Oh there's chocolate chip is there? Look I'm really sorry, if there wasn't any chocolate I would buy them. I would suggest that you guys sell more variations of cookies. And you turn them away whilst patting yourself on the back about how you've left them with something more valuable than money, some wonderful ideas.

## My Issue

There are all sorts of interesting characters out there in society. But this particular type of person just sets off a flame in me that very few people or situations can set off. I like honest rude people a million times better than pretentious nice people. As someone who is always trying to be nice, pretentious nice people always catch me off guard and mix in rude, hurtful or offensive comments in between the "I'm just trying to help", or "let's see what I can do". I don't like telling people off. I don't like calling people out. I don't like arguing with people. So I look for every excuse I can to understand the other person's perspective. When someone constantly throws me off with "considerate" comments when in fact they priorities their own image over my interest and welfare, it actually leads me to questions whether I've done something wrong or spiral into self-doubt as to why is this happening? I always try to look for faults in how I've behaved and what I've said, so when the situation is muddied by disingenuous niceness, I get confused. 

## Conclusion

Everyone have a different past, personality, mindset, surrounding and soul. Part of life is figuring out what sort of people are your kryptonite. I have found one of my many weaknesses. I will learn to deal with these people by learning to recognise them, and standing up for myself when they do try to slip in come snarky remark.
